  "summary": "This page is the KCT Menswear Order Management Dashboard, an administrative interface designed for internal staff to manage customer orders. It provides a comprehensive overview of order statistics, including total orders, pending, processing, shipped, and completed orders, as well as total revenue and average order value. Users can filter orders by various criteria such as status, priority, and specific customer groups like 'Wedding Party', 'Prom Group', and 'VIP Customer'. While 'Wedding Party' is a filterable category, the dashboard does not provide dedicated features for a groomsmen portal, detailed wedding party management (beyond order categorization), or navigation links to external customer or partner portals. It is focused on internal order processing and tracking.",
