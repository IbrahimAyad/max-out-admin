# Couples Portal - Quality Assurance Testing Report

**Testing Date:** August 19, 2025  
**Application URL:** https://610bor6wybd6.space.minimax.io  
**Tester:** QA Automation Agent  

## Executive Summary

The testing of the Couples Portal revealed **critical backend infrastructure issues** that prevent normal application functionality. While the authentication flow appears to be working at the frontend level, multiple HTTP 500 errors from the backend services are blocking users from accessing the main application features after login.

## Testing Scope and Methodology

**Planned Testing Areas:**
1. ‚úÖ Initial interface examination and authentication options identification
2. ‚ùå Wedding code authentication testing (blocked by backend errors)
3. ‚ùå Email/password login functionality testing (blocked by backend errors)
4. ‚ùå Session management verification (blocked by backend errors)
5. ‚ùå Error handling documentation (blocked by backend errors)
6. ‚ùå Mobile compatibility testing (blocked by backend errors)

**Testing Methodology:**
- Automated browser testing using professional QA tools
- Visual state analysis and documentation
- Console error monitoring
- Screenshot capture for evidence

## Key Findings

### üî¥ Critical Issues

#### 1. Backend Service Failures (Severity: Critical)
**Issue:** Multiple HTTP 500 errors from Supabase backend services
**Details:**
- Error: "Error loading profile: FunctionsHttpError: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code"
- Failed API endpoint: `profile-management` function
- Multiple consecutive failures with HTTP 500 status
- Impact: Prevents dashboard loading after authentication

**Evidence:**
```
Error loading profile: FunctionsHttpError: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code
API URL: https://gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz.supabase.co/functions/v1/profile-management
Response Status: 500
Error Type: HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error
```

#### 2. Dashboard Load Failures (Severity: Critical)
**Issue:** Users cannot access the main application dashboard
**Symptoms:**
- "Unable to load dashboard" error message displayed
- "Please try refreshing the page" user guidance
- Retry button present but ineffective due to backend issues
- Users stuck on error screen after authentication

### üü° Session Management Observations

**Positive Finding:** Strong session persistence detected
- Sessions persist across browser tabs
- Authentication state maintained during navigation
- Indicates robust frontend session management implementation

### üü° URL Redirect Behavior

**Observation:** Dynamic URL redirection occurring
- Original URL: `https://610bor6wybd6.space.minimax.io`
- Redirected to various subdomains during testing
- May indicate load balancing or CDN configuration

## Testing Status

| Test Area | Status | Result | Blocker |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| Initial Interface | ‚úÖ Completed | Interface accessible | None |
| Wedding Code Auth | ‚ùå Blocked | Cannot test due to backend errors | HTTP 500 errors |
| Email/Password Auth | ‚ùå Blocked | Cannot test due to backend errors | HTTP 500 errors |
| Session Management | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Session persistence confirmed | Backend errors prevent full testing |
| Error Handling | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Error messages displayed | Limited testing due to backend issues |
| Mobile Compatibility | ‚ùå Not Started | Cannot test | Backend errors prevent access |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required (Priority: Critical)

1. **Fix Backend Infrastructure**
   - Investigate and resolve HTTP 500 errors in Supabase profile-management function
   - Check server logs for detailed error information
   - Verify database connectivity and function deployment status

2. **Backend Health Monitoring**
   - Implement proper error logging and monitoring
   - Add health checks for critical backend services
   - Set up alerting for service failures

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Add more informative error messages for users
   - Implement better error recovery mechanisms
   - Consider implementing offline/degraded mode functionality

### Post-Fix Testing Plan

Once backend issues are resolved, the following testing should be completed:

1. **Authentication Flow Testing**
   - Test wedding code authentication with sample codes:
     - "WED-12345678-1234"
     - "WED-SAMPLE-CODE"
   - Test email/password login scenarios
   - Verify error handling for invalid credentials

2. **Session Management Testing**
   - Test session persistence across tabs
   - Verify logout functionality
   - Test session timeout behavior

3. **User Interface Testing**
   - Complete mobile compatibility testing
   - Verify responsive design elements
   - Test all interactive elements and forms

4. **Error Handling Verification**
   - Document all error messages and user feedback
   - Test recovery mechanisms
   - Verify user guidance is clear and helpful

## Technical Evidence

### Console Error Log Sample
```
Error #1: Error loading profile: FunctionsHttpError: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code
Error #2: HTTP 500 - https://gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz.supabase.co/functions/v1/profile-management
Error #3: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code (repeated)
```

### Screenshots Captured
1. `landing_page_restart.png` - Initial landing page state
2. `current_state_before_second_code.png` - Authentication flow state
3. `error_state_dashboard.png` - Dashboard error condition

## Conclusion

The Couples Portal application is currently **not functional** due to critical backend infrastructure issues. While the frontend appears to be properly implemented with good session management and error display capabilities, the backend services are experiencing HTTP 500 errors that prevent users from accessing core functionality.

**Recommendation:** Halt any user-facing deployment until backend issues are resolved. Focus immediate attention on diagnosing and fixing the Supabase function errors before proceeding with additional feature testing or user access.
