# Challenges & Next Steps - Development Roadmap

## üö® Current Challenges

### 1. Image Processing Pipeline ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
**Status:** Partially Implemented  
**Issue:** Limited image import functionality

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Primary image upload works
- ‚ùå Multiple images not processed
- ‚ùå Image optimization missing
- ‚ùå Fallback handling incomplete

**Required Improvements:**
- Process all vendor images (not just position 1)
- Image resizing and optimization
- Better error handling for failed downloads
- Batch image processing for performance
- Image quality validation

**Impact:** Products import without complete image galleries

### 2. Automatic Sync Scheduling üîß MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Status:** Manual Only  
**Issue:** No automated inventory updates

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Manual sync works perfectly
- ‚ùå No scheduled automatic sync
- ‚ùå No real-time webhooks

**Desired Features:**
- Hourly/daily automatic inventory sync
- Shopify webhook integration for real-time updates
- Configurable sync frequency per vendor
- Background job queue for large catalogs

### 3. Multi-Vendor Support üîß MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Status:** Single Vendor  
**Issue:** System designed for one vendor store

**Current Limitations:**
- Single Shopify store integration
- Hardcoded vendor credentials
- No vendor selection UI

**Expansion Needed:**
- Multiple vendor store connections
- Vendor management interface
- Per-vendor sync settings
- Vendor-specific product grouping rules

### 4. Inventory Accuracy Edge Cases üîß LOW PRIORITY
**Status:** Core Cases Covered
**Issue:** Some edge cases not handled

**Known Edge Cases:**
- Discontinued variants (should they be hidden?)
- Zero inventory items (import or skip?)
- Price changes during import
- SKU conflicts between vendors

## üéØ End Goal & Vision

### Complete Product & Inventory System
**Ultimate Objective:** Fully automated vendor product lifecycle management

**Target State:**
1. **Discovery:** New vendor products auto-detected
2. **Sync:** Real-time inventory updates via webhooks
3. **Review:** Vendor inbox shows complete product data
4. **Import:** One-click import with full image galleries
5. **Management:** Grouped products with variant tracking
6. **Analytics:** Inventory trends and vendor performance

### Business Goals
- **Efficiency:** Zero manual inventory entry
- **Accuracy:** Real-time inventory across all channels
- **Scalability:** Support 100+ vendors and 10,000+ products
- **Automation:** Hands-off inventory management
- **Intelligence:** Automated reorder suggestions
