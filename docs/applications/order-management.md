## 2. Order Lifecycle Management and Status Tracking

### Order Status Architecture

The system implements a comprehensive 14-status order lifecycle designed specifically for custom menswear operations[8]:

**Core Processing Statuses:**
- `pending_payment` - Initial order creation awaiting payment confirmation
- `payment_confirmed` - Payment processed, ready for production queue
- `processing` - Order entered production workflow
- `in_production` - Active manufacturing/tailoring phase
- `quality_check` - Quality assurance and inspection phase
- `packaging` - Final packaging and preparation for shipment

**Fulfillment Statuses:**
- `shipped` - Order dispatched with tracking information
- `out_for_delivery` - Package in final delivery phase
- `delivered` - Successfully delivered to customer
- `completed` - Order fully fulfilled and closed

**Exception Statuses:**
- `cancelled` - Order cancelled before completion
- `refunded` - Payment refunded to customer
- `on_hold` - Temporary processing suspension
- `exception` - Requires manual intervention

### Priority Management System

The application supports 8 distinct priority levels optimized for fashion retail operations[8]:

**Standard Priorities:**
- `low` - Non-urgent orders with flexible delivery
- `normal` - Standard processing timeline
- `high` - Expedited processing required
- `urgent` - Same-day or next-day processing

**Specialized Priorities:**
- `rush` - Maximum priority with accelerated timeline
- `wedding_party` - Coordinated group orders for weddings
- `prom_group` - Seasonal group orders for prom events
- `vip_customer` - High-value customer orders

### Status Tracking Implementation

```typescript
// Order status management with audit trail
const updateOrderStatus = async (orderId: string, newStatus: string) => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('orders')
    .update({ 
      status: newStatus,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      processed_at: newStatus === 'processing' ? new Date().toISOString() : null,
      shipped_at: newStatus === 'shipped' ? new Date().toISOString() : null
    })
    .eq('id', orderId)
}
```

The system maintains comprehensive status history through the `order_status_history` table[8], tracking:
- Previous and new status changes
- Processing duration in each status
- User or system-initiated changes
- Exception handling and resolution notes
- Automated action triggers
