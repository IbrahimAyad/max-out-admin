Create this script for easier deployments:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-all.sh

echo "Deploying KCT Ecosystem to Vercel..."

# Build all applications
npm run build:all

echo "All applications built successfully!"
echo "Push to GitHub to trigger Vercel deployments"

git add .
git commit -m "Deploy: Updated all applications"
git push origin main

echo "Deployment triggered! Check Vercel dashboard for progress."
```
