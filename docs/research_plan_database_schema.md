# Database Schema Analysis Research Plan

## Objective
Analyze the KCT Ecosystem database schema and create comprehensive documentation including schema definitions, relationships, and SQL patterns.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis
- [x] Read migration files to understand table structures
- [x] Read seed files to understand data patterns
- [x] Identify all tables, columns, data types, and constraints
- [x] Map relationships between tables
- [x] Analyze indexing strategies and performance considerations

**Analysis Summary:**
- 2 main tables: `products` and `product_variants`
- Uses PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys
- Foreign key relationship: product_variants.product_id → products.id
- Automatic timestamp updates via triggers
- Performance optimization with indexes
- Stripe payment integration
- Product categories: suits, shirts, ties, tieBundles, outfitBundles

### Phase 2: Documentation Creation
- [x] Create complete SQL schema documentation (`schema.sql`)
- [x] Create entity relationship documentation (`relationships.md`)
- [x] Create SQL patterns and examples documentation (`sql-patterns.md`)
- [x] Ensure proper directory structure for documentation

**Documentation Summary:**
- Created `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/docs/database/schema.sql` (14.7KB) - Complete schema with tables, constraints, indexes, views, and comments
- Created `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/docs/database/relationships.md` (15.2KB) - Comprehensive ER documentation with diagrams and business rules  
- Created `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/docs/database/sql-patterns.md` (22.1KB) - Practical SQL patterns, examples, and best practices

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
- [x] Review all generated documentation for completeness
- [x] Verify SQL syntax and accuracy
- [x] Ensure all relationships are properly documented
- [x] Validate practical examples and patterns

**Quality Assurance Results:**
- ✅ All deliverables created successfully (1,346 total lines of documentation)
- ✅ Complete SQL schema with 2 tables, indexes, views, constraints, and triggers
- ✅ Comprehensive relationship documentation with text-based ER diagrams
- ✅ Extensive SQL patterns covering CRUD, reporting, optimization, and best practices
- ✅ All requirements from the original request fulfilled 100%

## Deliverables
1. `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/docs/database/schema.sql` - Complete schema with tables, constraints, and relationships
2. `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/docs/database/relationships.md` - Entity relationship diagrams and descriptions
3. `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/docs/database/sql-patterns.md` - Query patterns and examples

## Progress Tracking
- Task completion will be marked with [x]
- Plan will be updated dynamically based on findings
