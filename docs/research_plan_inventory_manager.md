# Inventory Manager Application Analysis - Research Plan

## Task Overview
Analyze the Inventory Manager application in `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/apps/inventory-manager/` and create detailed technical documentation covering all key aspects of the system.

## Task Type: Verification-Focused Task
**Focus**: Deep architectural analysis and comprehensive documentation of an existing codebase.

## Main Requirements
1. Size-specific inventory tracking system architecture
2. Product and variant management workflows
3. Stock level monitoring and alert systems
4. Bulk operations and batch processing
5. Real-time update mechanisms
6. Component structure and UI patterns
7. Database integration and query patterns
8. API endpoints and data flows

## Research Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Codebase Exploration
- [x] 1.1 Examine main application structure and entry points
- [x] 1.2 Analyze component directory structure
- [x] 1.3 Review context providers and state management
- [x] 1.4 Examine hooks and custom utilities
- [x] 1.5 Review configuration files and environment setup

### Phase 2: Architecture Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Analyze the size-specific inventory tracking system
- [x] 2.2 Map out component hierarchy and data flow
- [x] 2.3 Identify database schemas and data models
- [x] 2.4 Document API integration patterns
- [x] 2.5 Analyze real-time update mechanisms

### Phase 3: Feature System Analysis
- [x] 3.1 Product and variant management workflows
- [x] 3.2 Stock level monitoring and alert systems
- [x] 3.3 Bulk operations and batch processing capabilities
- [x] 3.4 User interface patterns and component design
- [x] 3.5 Search, filtering, and sorting mechanisms

### Phase 4: Technical Deep Dive
- [x] 4.1 Database integration and query patterns
- [x] 4.2 API endpoints and data flows
- [x] 4.3 State management and data synchronization
- [x] 4.4 Error handling and validation patterns
- [x] 4.5 Performance optimization techniques

### Phase 5: Documentation Creation
- [x] 5.1 Create comprehensive technical documentation
- [x] 5.2 Include practical examples and code snippets
- [x] 5.3 Document architectural diagrams and workflows
- [x] 5.4 Provide implementation guidelines and best practices

### Phase 6: Final Review and Quality Check
- [x] 6.1 Review all documented features against requirements
- [x] 6.2 Ensure all 8 main requirements are fully covered
- [x] 6.3 Validate technical accuracy and completeness
- [x] 6.4 Final documentation review and formatting

## Output Deliverable
Comprehensive technical documentation saved to:
`/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/docs/applications/inventory-manager.md`

## Success Criteria
- All 8 specified areas fully documented
- Practical examples included for size matrix system
- Clear explanation of inventory operation handling
- Professional-grade technical documentation
- Complete architectural understanding demonstrated
