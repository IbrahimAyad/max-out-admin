# KCT Ecosystem API Documentation Research Plan

## Task Complexity Assessment
This is a **complex task** requiring comprehensive documentation creation for a full-stack ecosystem. The documentation must cover authentication, RESTful patterns, third-party integrations, real-time features, security, and testing patterns.

## Task Type: Documentation Creation Task
- **Focus**: Create comprehensive, practical API documentation with working examples
- **Requirements**: Cover all 10 specified areas across 3 documentation files
- **Target Audience**: All developers working within the KCT ecosystem

## Research and Documentation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation and Planning [X]
- [X] 1.1 Gather Supabase integration examples and best practices
- [X] 1.2 Collect Stripe payment integration patterns (single and subscription)
- [X] 1.3 Review web testing guidelines and frameworks
- [X] 1.4 Assess code example patterns for comprehensive coverage

### Phase 2: Authentication Documentation Creation [X]
- [X] 2.1 Create `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/docs/api/authentication.md`
  - [X] 2.1.1 Authentication endpoints and flows
  - [X] 2.1.2 JWT token handling and validation
  - [X] 2.1.3 User session management
  - [X] 2.1.4 Security considerations for authentication
  - [X] 2.1.5 Role-based access control patterns

### Phase 3: Core API Endpoints Documentation [X]
- [X] 3.1 Create `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/docs/api/endpoints.md`
  - [X] 3.1.1 RESTful API patterns and conventions
  - [X] 3.1.2 CRUD operations with Supabase integration
  - [X] 3.1.3 Supabase Edge Functions integration
  - [X] 3.1.4 Real-time subscriptions and WebSocket usage
  - [X] 3.1.5 Third-party API integrations (Stripe, SendGrid, EasyPost)
  - [X] 3.1.6 Error handling and response patterns
  - [X] 3.1.7 Rate limiting and security considerations

### Phase 4: Examples and Integration Patterns [X]
- [X] 4.1 Create `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/docs/api/examples.md`
  - [X] 4.1.1 Request/response examples and schemas
  - [X] 4.1.2 API testing and development patterns
  - [X] 4.1.3 Integration best practices across applications
  - [X] 4.1.4 Code examples for common use cases
  - [X] 4.1.5 Troubleshooting guide

### Phase 5: Final Review and Quality Assurance [X]
- [X] 5.1 Comprehensive review of all three documentation files
- [X] 5.2 Ensure all 10 requirements are fully covered
- [X] 5.3 Validate code examples are accurate and practical
- [X] 5.4 Check cross-references between documentation files
- [X] 5.5 Verify completeness against user requirements

## Success Criteria
