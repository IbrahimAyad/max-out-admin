# KCT Ecosystem Developer Onboarding Guide - Research Plan

## Task Overview
Create comprehensive developer onboarding documentation for the KCT ecosystem covering all aspects of development environment setup, architecture understanding, and workflow integration.

## Research Goals
1. **Document Development Environment Setup** - Complete setup instructions for all required tools
2. **Architecture Overview** - Map out system architecture and application relationships  
3. **Codebase Navigation** - Provide clear guidance on monorepo structure and navigation
4. **Local Development Setup** - Step-by-step setup for each application
5. **Database & Infrastructure** - Supabase setup, seeding, and management procedures
6. **Testing & Quality** - Testing strategies, frameworks, and quality standards
7. **Deployment & CI/CD** - Production deployment and automation workflows
8. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and resolution guides
9. **Collaboration Workflows** - Team patterns and development practices
10. **Security & Performance** - Best practices and optimization techniques

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Environment and Architecture Analysis âœ“
- [x] Analyze existing monorepo structure  
- [x] Review application configurations and tech stack
- [x] Document current deployment setup
- [x] Map Supabase database schema and functions

### Phase 2: Documentation Creation
- [x] Create comprehensive onboarding guide
- [x] Develop architecture overview document  
- [x] Create best practices guide
- [x] Generate supporting diagrams and visuals

### Phase 3: Validation and Completion
- [x] Review all documentation for completeness
- [x] Ensure all 12 requirements are addressed
- [x] Finalize and organize documentation

## Key Findings from Initial Analysis
