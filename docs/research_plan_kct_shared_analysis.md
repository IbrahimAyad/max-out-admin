# KCT Ecosystem Shared Resources Analysis Plan

## Task Overview
Analyze shared resources and common components across the KCT ecosystem monorepo to create comprehensive documentation covering components, utilities, and patterns.

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Shared Directory Structure Analysis
- [x] Examine `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/shared/` directory structure
- [x] Analyze shared components library (currently empty directories)
- [x] Review shared hooks and utilities (unified-auth.ts, profile-api.ts)
- [x] Document shared types and interfaces (found in utilities)
- [x] Examine shared constants and styles (empty directories)
- [x] Review shared Supabase configuration (in shared/supabase/)

### Phase 2: Common Components Analysis
- [x] Analyze shared React components across all applications (found common patterns)
- [x] Document UI patterns and design system (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS pattern)
- [x] Review component props and interfaces (TypeScript patterns)
- [x] Examine component composition patterns (Context providers, loading states)
- [x] Document reusable component library (LoadingSpinner, AuthForm patterns)

### Phase 3: Shared Utilities and Helper Functions
- [x] Review utility functions in shared/utils (unified-auth.ts and profile-api.ts)
- [x] Analyze authentication utilities (unified-auth.ts)
- [x] Examine profile API utilities (profile-api.ts with comprehensive interfaces)
- [x] Document helper function patterns (API response patterns, error handling)
- [x] Review common business logic (authentication bridging, profile management)

### Phase 4: Database Schema and Relationships
- [x] Analyze Supabase table definitions (weddings, wedding_party_members, etc.)
- [x] Review migration files for schema evolution (comprehensive migration system)
- [x] Document table relationships and foreign keys (UUID-based relationships)
- [x] Examine RLS policies and security patterns (admin and service role patterns)
- [x] Document data modeling patterns (JSONB usage for flexible data)

### Phase 5: Authentication and Authorization Patterns
- [x] Review unified authentication system (comprehensive unifiedAuthAPI)
- [x] Analyze authorization patterns across apps (service role vs anon key usage)
- [x] Document role-based access control (wedding codes, invitation codes)
- [x] Examine session management (cross-portal sessions)
- [x] Review security patterns (RLS policies, admin access patterns)

### Phase 6: API Patterns and Conventions
- [x] Analyze API integration patterns (Supabase functions pattern)
- [x] Review Supabase function patterns (admin-hub-api, wedding-management)
- [x] Examine data fetching strategies (function invocation patterns)
- [x] Document error handling patterns (try-catch with fallbacks)
- [x] Review API response formats (success/error object patterns)

### Phase 7: Configuration and Setup Patterns
- [x] Review Supabase configuration patterns (consistent URL and keys)
- [x] Analyze environment variable usage (hardcoded patterns for now)
- [x] Examine build and deployment configurations (Vite + TypeScript)
- [x] Document setup patterns across applications (consistent package.json scripts)

### Phase 8: Integration Patterns
- [x] Analyze how applications share code (monorepo with shared utilities)
- [x] Review cross-application communication (shared auth state)
- [x] Examine data synchronization patterns (profile sync functions)
- [x] Document service integration patterns (unified auth bridging)

### Phase 9: Documentation Creation
- [x] Create comprehensive components documentation
- [x] Create utilities and helpers documentation  
- [x] Create patterns and integration documentation
- [x] Review and validate all documentation
