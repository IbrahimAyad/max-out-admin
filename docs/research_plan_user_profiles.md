# User Profiles Application Analysis - Research Plan

## Task Overview
Analyze the User Profiles application in `/workspace/kct-ecosystem-monorepo/apps/user-profiles/` and create comprehensive technical documentation covering all aspects of customer profile management, measurement tracking, personalization, and ecosystem integration.

## Research Objectives
Create documentation for:
1. Customer profile management architecture
2. Measurement tracking and validation systems  
3. Preference management and personalization
4. Order history and analytics integration
5. Profile synchronization across applications
6. Privacy and security considerations
7. Component structure and state management
8. Database schema for user profiles and measurements
9. API endpoints and data flows
10. Authentication and authorization patterns
