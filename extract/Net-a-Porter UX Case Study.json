{"extracted_information": "This case study focuses on redesigning the Net-A-Porter mobile app (and website) to address user experience issues, specifically an 'overwhelming content and confusing layout' that contributes to a high bounce rate. The study used the double diamond process, user research (red route analysis, interviews, competitor analysis), and ideation methods (Crazy 8s, card sorting) to inform the redesign. Key findings indicated user frustration with content clutter, desire for specific features, and a perception that the existing app's inconsistent features (e.g., missing 'can we help?' from app vs. website) impact trust. The redesign aimed for a pleasant user experience, smooth navigation, and increased purchases by simplifying the homepage, improving navigation, and applying UX/UI design principles. The outcome involved high-fidelity wireframes that represented a minimalistic and consistent brand aesthetic, addressing overcrowding and enhancing accessibility.", "specifications": {"target_devices": {"mobile": "iPhone 13/14", "desktop": "MacBook Air 13"}, "typography": {"font_family": "Sans Serif - Inter Tight", "usage": "Regular format with added kerning and lines for hierarchy, adequate spacing.
