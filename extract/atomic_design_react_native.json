{"extracted_information": "The provided web content details the application of Atomic Design principles in React Native for structuring components and building hierarchical design systems. It defines Atomic Design, outlines its five levels (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages), and provides insights into component architecture and implementation strategies with code examples.", "specifications": {"atomic_design_overview": "Atomic Design is a file structure methodology inspired by chemistry concepts, breaking down page elements into simple buckets. It's used to build user interfaces in a modular manner, focusing on component creation. There is no standard for file/folder management in React Native, but Atomic Design offers a simple yet effective approach.", "methodology_in_react_native": "The Atomic Design methodology in React Native consists of five distinct levels, mirroring chemical concepts for component organization.", "atoms": {"definition": "Fundamental units and basic building blocks that cannot be further broken down.", "examples": "Inputs, buttons, color palettes, animations.", "characteristics": "Smallest possible units, easily and globally accessible, built for reusability with many states (e.g., disabled button/input).", "code_examples": ["Text.tsx (typography component)", "LoaderGrad.tsx (gradient activity indicator)"]}, "molecules": {"definition": "Atoms grouped together to form a new combined component, offering new qualities.", "examples": "An input group built using a view, input, and button (e.g., password input with show/hide functionality).", "code_examples": ["PrimeBtn.tsx (primary button component combining various elements)"]}, "organisms": {"definition": "Multiple molecules joined together to create a part of the interface, which are independent and reusable.", "characteristics": "Start to show a somewhat formed structure of the UI.", "examples": "Header, music controls (reusable across various pages with consistent structure).", "code_examples": ["BasicHeader.tsx (a header component combining round buttons and text)"]}, "templates": {"definition": "Multiple organisms grouped together to form the skeleton or blueprint of a page or layout.", "characteristics": "All aspects collectively come together in terms of design; do not hold any data to show on their own other than defaults required by UI designs."}, "pages": {"definition": "Instances of templates, representing the complete form of the design.", "characteristics": "Data is combined with templates to produce the desired result.
