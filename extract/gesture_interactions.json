{"extracted_information": "Gestures are touch-based interactions in mobile app design, enabling natural, intuitive user experiences like swipes, pinches, and taps. They simplify navigation, enhance usability, and are pivotal in modern mobile UI/UX by maximizing screen real estate, improving app efficiency, and enhancing overall user experience. This includes reducing reliance on visible buttons and allowing quicker actions.", "specifications": {"best_practices": ["Keep It Intuitive: Gestures should feel natural and align with user expectations (e.g., swipe left to delete).", "Provide Feedback: Use animations, vibrations, or sound effects to confirm successful gesture execution.", "Offer Alternatives: Always provide visible navigation or instructions for critical functions, as not all users are familiar with gestures.", "Avoid Overloading with Gestures: Focus on essential interactions that align with the appâ€™s purpose to prevent user confusion."]}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"name": "Tap", "description": "Most basic interaction, used to select or activate elements, open links, or interact with buttons.
