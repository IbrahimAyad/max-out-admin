{"extracted_information": "The React Native New Architecture, redesigned since 2018 and proven at scale by Meta's production apps as of 2024, addresses fundamental limitations of the legacy architecture. It was experimentally available from React Native 0.68 and is now the default for 0.76+ projects. Key components include JSI, TurboModules, and Fabric, which together enhance performance and development experience by enabling synchronous layout, concurrent rendering, and faster JavaScript/native communication.", "specifications": {"react_native_version_opt_in": "0.68 (experimental opt-in)", "react_native_version_default": "0.76+", "jsi_data_handling_example": "VisionCamera processes ~30 MB frame buffers, leading to ~2 GB/second data handling without serialization costs, demonstrating JSI's efficiency over the bridge."}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"name": "JavaScript Interface (JSI)", "description": "Replaces the asynchronous bridge, allowing JavaScript to directly hold references to C++ objects and vice-versa.
