{"raw_content": "{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"extracted_information\": \"TanStack Query is a powerful tool for asynchronous state management, server-state utilities, and data fetching in TS/JS applications, including React. It simplifies fetching, caching, updating, and managing async data without global state. While 'React Native' isn't explicitly mentioned, its compatibility with 'React' and general JavaScript/TypeScript environments implies applicability. \\n\\n**Server State Management Strategies & Caching:**\\nTanStack Query automatically handles caching, background updates, and stale data with zero-configuration. It promotes a declarative approach: users define data sources and freshness requirements, and the system manages the rest. It integrates with promises/async/await, avoiding global state, reducers, or complex configurations. Key features supporting server state management include auto caching, auto refetching, window focus refetching, polling/realtime queries, parallel queries, dependent queries, a first-class mutations API, automatic garbage collection, paginated/cursor queries, load-more/infinite scroll queries, scroll recovery, request cancellation, Suspense readiness, render-as-you-fetch, prefetching, variable-length parallel queries, offline support, and SSR support.\\n\\n**Best Practices (Implied by Design):**\\n\\n*   **Declarative & Automatic:** Reduces manual data fetching logic and boilerplate for caching, background updates, and stale data.\n*   **Simple & Familiar:** Leverages existing promise/async/await knowledge, eliminating the need for complex state management patterns like reducers or normalization systems.\n*   **Extensible:** Offers fine-grained configuration for each query observer instance, with dedicated devtools and robust APIs for infinite loading and mutations.\n*   **Efficiency:** Designed with zero dependencies, it's lean and battle-hardened, suitable for projects from hobbies to enterprise systems. It significantly reduces the amount of code needed for data fetching, caching, retries, and async operations.\",\n    \"specifications\": {\n      \"purpose\": \"Asynchronous state management, server-state utilities, data fetching\",\n      \"target_environments\": \"TS/JS, React, Vue, Solid, Svelte, Angular applications\",\n      \"data_handling\": \"Fetch, cache, update, wrangle async data\",\n      \"configuration\": \"Zero-configuration for basic caching, background updates, stale data\",\n      \"state_management_approach\": \"No global state, reducers, or normalization systems required\",\n      \"dependency_status\": \"Zero dependencies\",\n      \"api_familiarity\": \"Works with promises or async/await\"\n    },\n    \"pricing\": {},\n    \"features\": [\n      \"Backend agnostic\",\n      \"Dedicated Devtools\",\n      \"Auto Caching\",\n      \"Auto Refetching\",\n      \"Window Focus Refetching\",\n      \"Polling/Realtime Queries\",\n      \"Parallel Queries\",\n      \"Dependent Queries\",\n      \"Mutations API\",\n      \"Automatic Garbage Collection\",\n      \"Paginated/Cursor Queries\",\n      \"Load-More/Infinite Scroll Queries\",\n      \"Scroll Recovery\",\n      \"Request Cancellation\",\n      \"Suspense Ready!\",\n      \"Render-as-you-fetch\",\n      \"Prefetching\",\n      \"Variable-length Parallel Queries\",\n      \"Offline Support\",\n      \"SSR Support\",\n      \"Data Selectors\"\n    ],\n    \"statistics\": {},\n    \"temporal_info\": {},\n    \"geographical_data\": {},\n    \"references\": [\n      \"CodeRabbit (partner for code review)\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}
