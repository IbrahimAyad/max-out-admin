# Groomsmen Portal Website Analysis Report

**Test Date:** August 19, 2025  
**Website URL:** https://2wphf7fjxqxb.space.minimax.io  
**Test Account Used:** ahxqoboy@minimax.com / RJifvZ4OHN

## Executive Summary

The Groomsmen Portal website appears to be a wedding dashboard application, but is currently experiencing critical server-side issues that prevent access to its main functionality. While the authentication system works properly, the core dashboard features are completely inaccessible due to backend errors.

## Discovered Features and Structure

### 1. Authentication System ✅ Working
- **Login Page:** Clean, professional design with email/password authentication
- **Account Creation:** Successfully created test account using automated system
- **Security:** Password masking and proper form validation
- **Branding:** Clearly identifies as a "wedding dashboard" service

### 2. Dashboard Functionality ❌ Non-Functional
- **Primary Issue:** HTTP 500 server error from "groomsmen-dashboard" Edge Function
- **Error Details:** Supabase backend service failure preventing dashboard loading
- **Routing:** All pages redirect to `/dashboard` which cannot load content

### 3. E-commerce and Product Features ❌ Not Accessible
Due to the dashboard error, the following features could not be evaluated:
- Product listings
- Inventory management
- Sizing options
- Shopping cart functionality
- Order processing
- Payment systems

## Technical Issues Identified

### Critical Backend Error
```
Error: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code
HTTP 500 - Supabase Functions API failure
Function: groomsmen-dashboard
Project: gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz.supabase.co
```

### Routing Problems
- All URL paths (`/products`, `/shop`, `/signup`) redirect to `/dashboard`
- No alternative access points to website functionality
- Complete dependency on broken dashboard endpoint

## Pages Tested

| Page | URL | Status | Notes |
|------|-----|--------|-------|
| Home | `/` | ❌ Redirects to broken dashboard | No homepage content accessible |
| Login | `/login` | ✅ Working | Professional design, successful authentication |
| Dashboard | `/dashboard` | ❌ Server Error | Critical 500 error prevents loading |
| Products | `/products` | ❌ Redirects to dashboard | Cannot access product catalog |
| Shop | `/shop` | ❌ Redirects to dashboard | E-commerce features inaccessible |
| Signup | `/signup` | ❌ Redirects to dashboard | Cannot access registration form |

## Evidence Screenshots

1. `groomsmen_portal_login_page.png` - Working login interface
2. `groomsmen_portal_dashboard_error.png` - Initial dashboard error
3. `groomsmen_portal_dashboard_error_logged_in.png` - Post-login error state

## Intended Functionality (Based on Available Clues)

From the limited accessible content, the website appears designed to be:
- **Wedding Dashboard:** Central management system for wedding planning
- **Groomsmen Portal:** Specific focus on groomsmen-related services
- **E-commerce Platform:** Likely includes product ordering and inventory management
- **Account-Based System:** Personalized dashboards for users

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Backend Service:** Resolve the HTTP 500 error in the groomsmen-dashboard Edge Function
2. **Implement Error Handling:** Add proper fallbacks when dashboard fails to load
3. **Create Alternative Access:** Provide working homepage or product pages independent of dashboard

### For Future Testing
1. **Database Setup:** Ensure Supabase backend is properly configured and deployed
2. **Function Debugging:** Test Edge Functions in isolation before deployment
3. **Routing Review:** Implement proper routing that doesn't rely solely on dashboard access

### Testing Blockers
- Cannot evaluate core business functionality due to server errors
- Unable to assess product catalog, inventory, or e-commerce features
- No access to sizing options or groomsmen-specific services
- Cannot test user experience beyond authentication

## Conclusion

While the Groomsmen Portal shows promise with a professional login interface and clear wedding service focus, critical backend failures prevent any meaningful evaluation of its intended e-commerce and product management functionality. The website requires immediate technical resolution before user acceptance testing can proceed.

**Status:** ❌ Not ready for production use  
**Priority:** Critical - Backend service failure blocking all functionality
