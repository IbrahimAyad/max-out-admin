# Groomsmen Portal Testing Report

## Executive Summary
During testing of the groomsmen portal at https://2wphf7fjxqxb.space.minimax.io, I encountered significant technical issues that prevented full exploration of the portal's intended features. The system appears to be designed as a comprehensive groomsmen portal but is currently experiencing backend functionality issues.

## Testing Details

### Test Credentials
- **Email:** yswzwtyv@minimax.com
- **Password:** 5q7TRPpOt6
- **Target URL:** https://2wphf7fjxqxb.space.minimax.io

### Portal Access Attempts

#### 1. Initial Navigation Issues
- **Finding:** Multiple URL redirections occurred during navigation attempts
- **Observed Behavior:** 
  - Original URL redirected to various paths including `/dashboard`, `/customers`, `/analytics`
  - Page title confirmed as "groomsmen-portal-unified-auth" indicating correct portal identification
  - Encountered "Unable to load dashboard" error messages repeatedly

#### 2. Authentication Interface Discovery
- **Finding:** Successfully located admin login interface for KCT Menswear system
- **Interface Features:**
  - Email and password input fields
  - "Existing Account" login option
  - "Quick Admin Access (Testing)" button
  - "Debug Info" option
- **Issue:** Login form interaction experienced timeout errors preventing credential entry

#### 3. System Integration Analysis
- **Finding:** Portal appears to be integrated with KCT Menswear order management system
- **Related Features Identified:**
  - "Wedding Party" priority classification in order management
  - Order filtering and management capabilities
  - Customer management integration
  - Revenue and analytics tracking

### Technical Issues Discovered

#### Backend API Failures
**Critical Error:** HTTP 404 errors when loading groomsmen-specific functionality

```
API Endpoint: https://gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz.supabase.co/functions/v1/groomsmen-dashboard
Error: HTTP 404 - Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code
```

**Impact:** Prevents access to:
- Groomsmen dashboard functionality
- Profile creation features
- Measurements management
- Outfit coordination tools
- Timeline features
- Communication capabilities

#### Authentication Issues
- Form input timeouts preventing credential entry
- Automatic redirections bypassing login process
- Session management inconsistencies

### Expected Features (Based on System Architecture)

#### Profile Management
- **Intended Functionality:** Individual groomsmen profile creation and management
- **Status:** Inaccessible due to backend errors

#### Measurements System
- **Intended Functionality:** Digital measurement capture and storage
- **Status:** Inaccessible due to backend errors

#### Outfit Coordination
- **Intended Functionality:** Wedding party outfit selection and coordination
- **Status:** Partially indicated through "Wedding Party" order priority classification

#### Timeline Management
- **Intended Functionality:** Wedding preparation timeline and milestone tracking
- **Status:** Inaccessible due to backend errors

#### Communication Features
- **Intended Functionality:** Groomsmen-to-groomsmen and wedding party communication
- **Status:** Inaccessible due to backend errors

### Mobile Responsiveness Testing
**Status:** Unable to complete due to backend functionality issues
**Planned Approach:** Would have tested responsive design across different viewport sizes

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### System Status
- **Portal Infrastructure:** Present and correctly identified
- **Authentication System:** Partially functional with interaction issues
- **Backend Services:** Experiencing critical failures (HTTP 404 errors)
- **Frontend Interface:** Loads but cannot access core functionality

### Immediate Issues Requiring Resolution
1. **Backend API Restoration:** Fix HTTP 404 errors for groomsmen-dashboard function
2. **Authentication Form Fixes:** Resolve input field timeout issues
3. **Session Management:** Address automatic redirection problems

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Backend Investigation:** Debug and restore groomsmen-dashboard API endpoint
2. **Database Connectivity:** Verify Supabase function deployment and configuration
3. **Frontend Error Handling:** Improve error messaging and fallback behaviors
4. **Testing Environment:** Establish stable testing environment for feature validation

### Alternative Testing Approach
Once backend issues are resolved, recommended testing sequence:
1. Successful authentication with provided credentials
2. Complete profile creation workflow
3. Measurements input and management testing
4. Outfit coordination feature exploration
5. Timeline functionality validation
6. Communication tools testing
7. Mobile responsiveness verification across devices
