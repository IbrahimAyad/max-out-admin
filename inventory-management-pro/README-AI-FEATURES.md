# AI Features Implementation

This document explains the AI and analytics features that have been implemented in the inventory management system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Analytics Tracking
- **Page Views**: Automatic tracking of page visits across the application
- **Product Views**: Track when users view product details
- **Product Edits**: Track when users edit products
- **Product Updates**: Track successful product updates with change details
- **Event Tracking**: Generic event tracking for custom analytics

### 2. Smart Collections
- **AI-Powered Collections**: Automatically curated collections based on trends and algorithms
- **Dynamic Collections**: Rule-based collections that update automatically
- **Manual Collections**: Traditional manually curated collections
- **Collection Management**: Full CRUD interface for managing collections

### 3. Product Recommendations
- **Cross-Sell Recommendations**: Suggest related products from different categories
- **Upsell Recommendations**: Suggest higher-value alternatives
- **Complementary Recommendations**: Suggest products that go well together
- **Similar Product Recommendations**: Suggest products in the same category
- **Trending Products**: Display trending products based on view analytics

### 4. Analytics Dashboard
- **Real-time Metrics**: Page views, product views, and edit statistics
- **Performance Charts**: Visual representations of activity over time
- **Category Performance**: Breakdown of performance by product category
- **Recent Activity Feed**: Live feed of user actions and events

## Implementation Details

### Analytics Integration
Analytics are automatically tracked in the following components:
- `Dashboard.tsx`: Tracks dashboard page views
- `ProductDetails.tsx`: Tracks product views and fetches recommendations
- `EditProduct.tsx`: Tracks edit starts and successful updates
- `CollectionsManager.tsx`: Tracks collection views

### Database Tables
The following Supabase tables are used for AI features:
- `analytics_page_views`: Store page view events
- `analytics_events`: Store general analytics events
- `analytics_product_performance`: Aggregate product performance data
- `smart_collections`: AI and dynamic collections
- `collection_products`: Products associated with collections
- `product_recommendations`: AI-generated product recommendations

### Smart Recommendations Display
Product recommendations are displayed on the ProductDetails page in a dedicated "Smart Recommendations" sidebar section that shows:
- Product thumbnail or placeholder
- Product name (clickable link)
- Recommendation reason
- Price and match percentage
- Click tracking for recommendation effectiveness

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Ensure all required tables exist in your Supabase instance. The tables should have been created as part of the previous setup.

### 2. Seed Sample Data
To populate the system with sample AI data for demonstration:

```bash
# Option 1: Using SQL script
psql -d your_database < seed-ai-data.sql

# Option 2: Using Node.js script (requires SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key node populate-ai-features.js
```

### 3. Authentication Requirements
The analytics and AI features work with both authenticated and anonymous users, but some features may require authentication depending on your RLS policies.

## Usage

### Viewing Analytics
1. Navigate to the Dashboard to see basic analytics in the stats cards
2. Access the full Analytics Dashboard for detailed metrics and charts

### Managing Smart Collections
1. Use the Collections Manager to create and manage smart collections
2. Set up rules for dynamic collections
3. Manually curate collections as needed

### Product Recommendations
1. Recommendations automatically appear on product detail pages
2. Click tracking provides insights into recommendation effectiveness
3. Recommendations are generated based on category relationships and user behavior

### Tracking Events
Analytics events are automatically tracked, but you can also manually track custom events:

```typescript
import analytics from '../lib/analytics'

// Track a custom event
analytics.trackEvent({
  event_type: 'custom_action',
  product_id: 'optional-product-id',
  properties: {
    custom_data: 'any value',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }
})
```

## Performance Considerations

- Analytics calls are made asynchronously and won't block the UI
- Failed analytics calls are logged but don't affect the user experience
- Recommendation queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Analytics data is aggregated for performance on dashboard displays

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Connect to external ML services for better recommendations
2. **A/B Testing**: Framework for testing different recommendation algorithms
3. **Real-time Analytics**: WebSocket-based real-time analytics updates
4. **Advanced Segmentation**: User behavior-based product segmentation
5. **Predictive Analytics**: Inventory forecasting based on trends

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No Recommendations Showing**: Ensure products exist and recommendations have been generated
2. **Analytics Not Tracking**: Check browser console for errors and network requests
3. **Collections Not Updating**: Verify that collection rules are properly configured

### Debug Mode
Set `localStorage.debug = 'analytics'` in the browser console to enable debug logging for analytics events.
