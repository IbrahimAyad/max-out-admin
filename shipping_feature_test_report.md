## Critical Issues Identified

### üî¥ High Priority: Missing Core Feature
- **Issue**: Shipping package selector dropdown is not rendered in the UI

- **Actual Behavior**: Only shipping carrier rates are displayed, no package selector visible

### üü° Medium Priority: Incomplete Form
- **Issue**: Shipping rate calculator form is incomplete
- **Impact**: Users cannot input shipping details properly
- **Expected Behavior**: Form should include address fields, package dimensions, weight inputs
- **Actual Behavior**: Only "Shipping To:" label visible without input fields

### üü° Medium Priority: Secondary Bug
- **Issue**: Order items not loading properly ("No items found for this order")
- **Impact**: Cannot verify item-specific package suggestions
- **Location**: Order Details tab

## Test Results Summary

| Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Login to dashboard | Successful authentication | ‚úÖ Login successful via Quick Admin Access | PASS |
| Navigate to order | Access order details | ‚úÖ Successfully accessed Order KCT-1755444657167-SXV0 | PASS |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Investigate Missing UI Component**: The shipping package selector dropdown needs to be implemented or fixed
2. **Complete Form Implementation**: Add missing input fields for the shipping rate calculator
3. **Debug Package Templates**: Verify that the 11 package templates are properly loaded and rendered
4. **Fix Order Items Display**: Resolve the "No items found" issue affecting package suggestions

### Development Verification
1. Check if the package selector component is properly integrated in the shipping management module
2. Verify API endpoints for package templates are working correctly
3. Test package selector functionality in development environment
4. Ensure auto-suggestion logic is implemented for different product types

## Conclusion
The shipping package selector feature test **FAILED** due to the complete absence of the required UI element. While the basic shipping functionality works (rate calculation and display), the new package selector feature with 11 templates is not implemented or not rendering properly in the current deployment.

**Status**: ‚ùå BLOCKED - Primary feature not available for testing

## Next Steps
1. Development team should investigate why the package selector dropdown is not rendering
2. Once the UI element is available, re-run the complete test suite
3. Verify package templates are properly configured and accessible
4. Test the complete workflow including auto-suggestions and rate updates
