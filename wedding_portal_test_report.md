   - Visual components timing out due to API errors

### üîß User Experience Issues

   - No loading states during API calls
   - No error messages displayed to users

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Screenshot/visual analysis timing out
   - Likely caused by JavaScript errors from failed API calls

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required (Critical Priority)
1. **Fix Backend API Infrastructure**
   - Investigate and resolve HTTP 500 errors in wedding-management API
   - Restore notifications API service (HTTP 503)
   - Verify database connectivity and Supabase configuration

2. **Implement Error Handling**
   - Add user-friendly error messages for API failures
   - Implement loading states for async operations
   - Add success confirmations for wedding creation

### Post-Backend Fix Testing
Once backend systems are restored, re-test:
- Wedding creation and data persistence
- Party member invitation workflows
- Outfit coordination features
- Timeline management
- Payment integration
- Communication features

## Conclusion
The Wedding Portal shows promise with a well-designed frontend interface and comprehensive wedding creation wizard. However, **critical backend system failures** prevent functional testing and would severely impact user experience in production. 

**Immediate backend system repair is essential** before the portal can be considered functional for couples planning their weddings.
